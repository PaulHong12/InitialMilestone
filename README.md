# InitialMilestone

## This is the repository for Project Milestone 4: Initial Step
This repository includes image extraction and preprocessing, DDPM for minority class image generation for overian cancer tissue, and CLAM model for classifications.


## **Goal**

Build a generative model to generate histopathological sections of ovarian cancer (especially minority samples), add the generated samples to the training of the original classification model, and observe whether the classification performance of the original classification model is improved.
